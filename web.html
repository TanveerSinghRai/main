        Hey! I’m Tanveer Singh Rai, a 20-year-old BCA student from Punjab. Ever since I discovered the world of technology, I’ve been deeply passionate about exploring how things work behind the scenes — from websites and games to software and systems. I’m currently diving deep into web development, software engineering, and learning modern programming languages like C++, Go, and Python.

        I enjoy creating clean, functional websites and experimenting with UI/UX design. Whether it’s a simple portfolio or a complex web app, I love turning ideas into real projects that people can interact with. Coding isn’t just a skill for me — it’s a way to express creativity and solve real-world problems.
        
        Beyond coding, I’m a curious learner and an avid gamer. I grew up playing titles like GTA, Mafia II, NFS Most Wanted, and BGMI, which fueled my love for immersive digital worlds. These games taught me the value of design, storytelling, and user experience. I still revisit some of them for inspiration (and nostalgia).
        
        In my downtime, I like to read books on self-growth, psychology, and productivity. Titles like "Atomic Habits," "The Laws of Human Nature," and "How to Win Friends and Influence People" have helped shape my mindset and habits.
        
        This site is my little corner of the internet — where I document my journey, share projects, and maybe even inspire others starting out. Whether you’re here to check out my work or just stumbled by, I appreciate you taking the time. Feel free to connect, explore, or just vibe around.
        
        Thanks for stopping by!
